# Tools-for-data-from-a-cosmological-simulation
My final degree project in physics: Inertia tensor of structures at different scales in cosmological simulations.
A compilation of diferent tools and packages to calculate some physics parameters of interest: read Big Endian files, Aitoff's projections, a lot of plots (scatter3d, scatter2d, plot3d,barplots with modifications...), eigenvalues and eigenvector, inertia ellipsoids, creating and saving files, creating and reading directories, techniques to calculate center of mass with several tolerances...
\\
In these 5 volumes you can find different types of mechanics to plot, to implement tolerance in loops and conditional structures ... in Python.\\
You can use these mechanics to inspire your code.
