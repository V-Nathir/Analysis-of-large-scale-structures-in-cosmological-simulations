# Tools-for-data-from-a-cosmological-simulation
My final degree project in physics: Inertia tensor of structures at different scales in cosmological simulations.
A compilation of diferentes tools and packages to calculate some physics parameters of interest: read Big Endian files, Aitoff's projections, a lot of plots (scatter3d, scatter2d, plot3d,barplots with modifications...), eigenvalues and eigenvector, inertia ellipsoids, creating and saving files, creating and reading directories
